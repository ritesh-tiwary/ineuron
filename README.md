Title: Archive All Logs on 31st December Every Year

Story: As a system administrator, I want all logs to be archived on 31st December every year, so that we can maintain an organized and efficient log management system.

Acceptance Criteria:

Archiving Process:

The system should automatically initiate the log archiving process at 11:59 PM on 31st December every year.
All logs generated throughout the year should be archived.
Archiving Location:

The archived logs should be stored in a designated archive directory on the server.
The archived logs should be named with a timestamp and year for easy identification, e.g., logs_2023.zip.
```
