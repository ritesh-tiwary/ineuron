Hi Chetan,

Thank you for your email.

I understand the concern about creating multiple workspaces for a single engagement. However, I believe that establishing a new workspace is necessary due to the following reasons:

Isolation and Organization: Each API deployment can have unique configurations, dependencies, and security requirements. Isolating them in separate workspaces ensures that these elements do not interfere with each other, maintaining a clean and organized environment.

Resource Management: Different APIs may have varying resource consumption patterns. By allocating them to distinct workspaces, we can better manage and monitor resource usage, ensuring optimal performance and scalability.

Access Control and Security: Separate workspaces provide finer control over access permissions. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches, thereby protecting our system and data integrity.

Testing and Development Efficiency: Having a dedicated workspace for each API allows for more efficient testing and development. This segregation helps in identifying and resolving issues more effectively without impacting other APIs.

Scalability: As our engagement grows and more APIs are added, having individual workspaces will facilitate easier scaling and maintenance. It will also help in tracking changes and updates more systematically.

Distinct Codebase: The new records-keeping storage API has a completely different codebase compared to our existing APIs. Managing this distinct codebase within its own workspace will help in avoiding any conflicts or integration issues.

Unique Functionality: The functionality of the new records-keeping storage API is significantly different from our current APIs. A separate workspace would ensure that its unique requirements are met effectively without compromising the performance of other APIs.

I would be happy to discuss this in more detail. I will book a time tomorrow in the second half for us to go over this.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Best regards,
```
